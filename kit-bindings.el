;; CUA rectangle selection (from the .el file)
;; To start a rectangle, use [C-return] and extend it using the normal
;; movement keys (up, down, left, right, home, end, C-home,
;; C-end). Once the rectangle has the desired size, you can cut or
;; copy it using C-w and M-w, and you can
;; subsequently insert it - as a rectangle - using C-y.  So
;; the only new command you need to know to work with cua-mode
;; rectangles is C-return!
;;
;; Normally, when you paste a rectangle using C-v (C-y), each line of
;; the rectangle is inserted into the existing lines in the buffer.
;; If overwrite-mode is active when you paste a rectangle, it is
;; inserted as normal (multi-line) text.
;;
;; And there's more: If you want to extend or reduce the size of the
;; rectangle in one of the other corners of the rectangle, just use
;; [return] to move the cursor to the "next" corner.  Or you can use
;; the [M-up], [M-down], [M-left], and [M-right] keys to move the
;; entire rectangle overlay (but not the contents) in the given
;; direction.
;;
;; [C-return] cancels the rectangle
;; [C-space] activates the region bounded by the rectangle

;; cua-mode's rectangle support also includes all the normal rectangle
;; functions with easy access:
;;
;; [M-a] aligns all words at the left edge of the rectangle
;; [M-b] fills the rectangle with blanks (tabs and spaces)
;; [M-c] closes the rectangle by removing all blanks at the left edge
;;       of the rectangle
;; [M-f] fills the rectangle with a single character (prompt)
;; [M-i] increases the first number found on each line of the rectangle
;;       by the amount given by the numeric prefix argument (default 1)
;;       It recognizes 0x... as hexadecimal numbers
;; [M-k] kills the rectangle as normal multi-line text (for paste)
;; [M-l] downcases the rectangle
;; [M-m] copies the rectangle as normal multi-line text (for paste)
;; [M-n] fills each line of the rectangle with increasing numbers using
;;       a supplied format string (prompt)
;; [M-o] opens the rectangle by moving the highlighted text to the
;;       right of the rectangle and filling the rectangle with blanks.
;; [M-p] toggles virtual straight rectangle edges
;; [M-P] inserts tabs and spaces (padding) to make real straight edges
;; [M-q] performs text filling on the rectangle
;; [M-r] replaces REGEXP (prompt) by STRING (prompt) in rectangle
;; [M-R] reverse the lines in the rectangle
;; [M-s] fills each line of the rectangle with the same STRING (prompt)
;; [M-t] performs text fill of the rectangle with TEXT (prompt)
;; [M-u] upcases the rectangle
;; [M-|] runs shell command on rectangle
;; [M-'] restricts rectangle to lines with CHAR (prompt) at left column
;; [M-/] restricts rectangle to lines matching REGEXP (prompt)
;; [C-?] Shows a brief list of the above commands.

;; [M-C-up] and [M-C-down] scrolls the lines INSIDE the rectangle up
;; and down; lines scrolled outside the top or bottom of the rectangle
;; are lost, but can be recovered using [C-z].
